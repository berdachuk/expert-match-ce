Based on the following query and identified gaps, generate 2-3 refined search queries:

Original Query: <originalQuery>

<if(hasGaps)>
Identified Gaps:
<identifiedGaps>

<endif>
<if(hasAmbiguities)>
Ambiguities:
<ambiguities>

<endif>
<if(hasMissingInfo)>
Missing Information:
<missingInformation>

<endif>
Generate refined queries that would help fill these gaps.
Return as a JSON array of query strings:
["refined query 1", "refined query 2", "refined query 3"]
